# Background

The application of machine learning within the [GLAM](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAM_(cultural_heritage)>) sector is of increasing interest. We think it's important that the application of machine learning isn't only focused on novel research applications or central tasks like layout-recognition / Optical Character Recognition, but also used for mundane applications. `flyswot` is focused on exploring one of these more 'mundane' machine learning applications.

As part of this more 'mundane' application of machine learning, a command line tool has a numbr of nice features:

- It brings the model to the user. They can run the model on the device they use for their work. This hopefully helps demistify the process
- Command Line Applications are already used for other tasks by HMD so there is more potential to fit `flyswot` into existing workflows
- `flyswot` is focused on trying to also highlight important information about the model and the models performance to end-users.
